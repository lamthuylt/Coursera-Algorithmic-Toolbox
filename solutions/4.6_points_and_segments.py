PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a set of points and a set of segments on a line, compute, for each point, 
the number of segments it is contained in.
Input: A list of segments and a list of points
Output: The number of segments containing each point.

SAMPLE
Segments: [0,5], [7,10]
Points: 1,6,11
Output: 1,0,0

>>> points_cover_fast([0,7], [5,10], [1,6,11])
[1, 0, 0]
>>> points_cover_fast([-10], [10], [-100, 100, 0])
[0, 0, 1]
>>> points_cover_fast([0, -3, 7], [5, 2, 10], [1, 6])
[2, 0] 
>>> points_cover_fast([0, 2, 4], [5, 2, 10], [1, 6, 2, 2])
[1, 1, 2, 2]

ALGO
Concatenate all coordinates of segments and points into an array. By sorting that array,
we can easisly see whether a point is contained in a segment. 
For example, the sorted array of the sample 1 above is [0 (1) 5] (6) [7 10] (11), which 
shows that the point (1) is contained in one segment, while (6) and (11) are not.

TIME COMPLEXITY
O(mnlogmn) -> O(nlogn) (for sorting)
